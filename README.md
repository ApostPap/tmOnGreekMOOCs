# Topic Modeling for Greek MOOCs
Code used in the research paper 
- Apostolos Papadopoulos and Stavros Demetriadis, "Applying Topic Modeling to Massive Open Online Courses", Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, March 2021.

The scope of this paper is to implement algorithms for topic modeling in the final answers given by students in Greek Massively Open Online Courses (MOOC).

The algorithms implemented in this paper are:
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization(NMF or NNMF)
- Gibbs sampling for Dirichlet Mixture Model (GSDMM) from the [gsdmm](https://github.com/rwalk/gsdmm) repository
- Semantics-assisted Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SeaNMF) from the [SeaNMF](https://github.com/tshi04/SeaNMF) repository
